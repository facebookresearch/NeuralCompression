    """Estimates approximate tail quantiles.

    A simple Adam iteration is ran to determine tail quantiles. The objective
    is to find an :math:`x` such that :math:`func(x) = target`. For instance,
    if :math:`func` is a CDF and :math:`target` is a quantile value, this would
    find the approximate location of that quantile. Note that :math:`func` is
    assumed to be monotonic.

    When each tail estimate has passed the optimal value of :math:`x`, the
    algorithm does 100 additional iterations and then stops. This operation is
    vectorized. The tensor shape of :math:`x` is given by :math:`shape`, and
    :math:`target` must have a shape that is broadcastable to the output of
    :math:`func(x)`.

    Args:
        func: a function that computes the cumulative distribution function,
            survival function, or similar.
        target: desired target value.
        shape: shape representing :math:`x`.
        device: PyTorch device.
        dtype: PyTorch dtype of the computation and the return value.

    Returns:
        the solution, :math:`x`.
